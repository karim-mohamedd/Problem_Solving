# Problem Solving in C

## Overview

**Problem Solving in C** is a collection of implementations for various computational problems using the C programming language. This repository includes algorithms for sorting, searching, and other common problems, demonstrating practical problem-solving techniques and algorithmic strategies.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Compiler**: GCC or any compatible C compiler.
- **Build System**: Make (optional but recommended for building projects).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/problem-solving-c.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd problem-solving-c
   ```

### Building the Project

If you are using a `Makefile`, you can build the project by running:

```bash
make
```

This will compile all the source files and generate the executable binaries. If a `Makefile` is not provided, you can manually compile individual files:

```bash
gcc -o program_name source_file.c
```

Replace `program_name` with the desired name for the executable and `source_file.c` with the name of the C source file.

### Running the Programs

After building the project, you can run the executable binaries. For example:

```bash
./program_name
```

Replace `program_name` with the name of the executable you want to run.


## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for new algorithms or improvements, please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**

2. **Create a New Branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-algorithm
   ```

3. **Commit Your Changes**

   ```bash
   git commit -am 'Add new algorithm'
   ```

4. **Push to the Branch**

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/new-algorithm
   ```

5. **Create a Pull Request**

   Go to the repository on GitHub and open a new pull request.
